# Student Test Score 
This webpage calls data from an external API and displays a student component for each object in the JSON array. Student components are composed of a profile image, name, occupation, skills and test scores. App offers expandable views of a student's previous test scores, rather than just showing the average. Rather only see student test scores, DOM manipulation was integrated by giving each student component state to offer user input to create custom hashtags for each student (can have as little or many as you want). Lastly, state was used in a search by name (first or last) algorithm to display results.
